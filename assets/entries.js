        <p>
        I'm not sure what I want this blog to be yet, it's hard to coherently share 
        thoughts when I have so many veried passions: music, technology, politics, 
        film, social studies, travel and language. I guess I'll just throw everything
        at the wall and see what sticks - eventually things will sort themselves out. 
        I look forward to creating some interesting content, so stay tuned. 
        </p>
