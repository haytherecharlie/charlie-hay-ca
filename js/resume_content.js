	cover_letter: "Hi, I am Charlie Hay, a 29 year old software developer who absolutely loves programming and development. I take great pride in my work and always strive to challenge my ability in order to improve. I graduated from The University of Western Ontario in 2011 where I studied Computer Science and Psychology, and since then, I have worked at Apple, Disney and currently Mindgeek in Montreal. I have seen many changes in the short amount of time that I have worked professionally, and thankfully, that is what I believe keeps things fun. My current position challenges me to put efficiency first in everything I do. Mindgeek owns dozens of websites that see millions of users each month, it is my job to work on the platform that powers them all. On a daily basis I work in Javascript, PHP, SQL, and a variety of other shell scripting languages and IDEs. I love Git and everything it does to save me from pulling out my hair, especially on those bad days, and most importantly I always subscribe to the latest instructional programming videos and tutorials. (My current favourite is a gentleman by the name of Wes Bos.)<p> Previously I worked for Disney/ABC International Television’s content distribution service. I worked with a team of 8 on a portal where affiliates and other television and film distributers could order and obtain copies of Disney/ABC materials. The project was built using the PHP framework Laravel, and the front end used VueJS which is one of the nicest front end frameworks available. Speed and scalability were our main concern, as we regularly needed to query millions of titles and grew by around 3000 users each month. Finally I worked at Apple as a Product Expert which is more of an evangelist position for their products and services. I was responsible for leading training seminars for sales staff and required to know the ins and outs of all things Apple. There is plenty more about me below, and I would also love to hear from you and discuss things further, feel free to contact me at 1 (438) 880-5966. Thank you.",
