	cover_letter: "Hi, I am Charlie Hay, a 28-year old web application developer who is passionate about javascript and all it quirks. I am a graduate of Western University where I studied Computer Science and Psychology. Currently, I work as an Intermediate Software Engineer at Mindgeek in Montreal. Mindgeek is a world leader in video content distribution with monthly traffic exceeding 100 million unique users. Maintaining a platform of this scale is no easy task, we leverage all of the latest technologies including React, Webpack and Restful APIs, while also remaining truly agile. Before working at Mindgeek, I was a Web Application Developer for The Walt Disney Company in their content distribution service where I was responsible for designing and maintaining all front-end code (VueJS, SASS, HTML) . Our project was built in PHP Laravel on the back-end. Before that I was an Expert at Apple Retail where I coached and mentored a team of over 50 employees, taught programming lessons to the public and helped implement key technologies into the store. I absolutely love what I do, and in my spare time outside of work code apps in React, Node, MongoDB and Express. I have been programming since I was 12 years old, but continue to learn new frameworks and languages on a continuing basis. Outside of my passion for programming, I love travelling, playing guitar and piano, cooking and French culture. I even spent a year living/studying in Paris, France and attained my B2 (advanced) certification in written and oral French. There is plenty more to know about me, and I look forward to having a conversation with you sometime in the near future. Please feel free to contact me at your convince at charlie.hay@outlook.com",

With monthly traffic in the hundreds of millions, it is important that front end technologies are leveraged to minimize the number of requests and to ensure that all javascript code runs efficiently. Our front end is written in React/ES6 in order to maximize efficiency and to ensure the longitivtiy of our components. We are constantly adopting new technologies, and evolving at a faster pace than most others in the industry.",

Upon completion of this task, I reworked our front end build environment in Elixir to work with our Laravel backend and started work on two other projects. A normal day for me included developing front-end UI Elements, performing code reviews, writing new features in Vue and drinking lots of coffee. ",

Things like, providing open and honest feedback on a constant basis, offering assistance while also empowering others to discover answers for themeselves, and being allowed to fail quickly and often so that they can fearlessly move forward. Some of these concepts are still foreign to many companies, but they create an environment that encourage people to grow rather than maintain a comfortable status quo. As an Expert it was my job to mentor and lead a team of 50+ people in both technical knowledge and customer service.",
